# Predicting-Stock-Prices-using-Machine-learning
This project focuses on building a predictive model for stock prices using machine learning techniques, with a particular emphasis on time-series forecasting. Stock market data is inherently noisy and complex, but with the right algorithms and preprocessing techniques, we can extract patterns and trends that help predict future price movements.
